Buffer2[0]: Rust is an iron oxide, a usually reddish brown oxide formed by the ++reaction++ of iron ++++and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. Buffer2[1]: Given sufficient time, any iron mass, in the presence of water and oxygen, could ++^eventually convert entirely to rust.
